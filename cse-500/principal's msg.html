Welcome to our website. It is a pleasure to share our views and thoughts through this website. Our mission is to mould a child into a complete human being. For grooming a child along with teachers and teaching aids, a perfect learning environment is a prerequisite. In juxtaposition to ensure need-base education, Rajshahi Cantonment Public School & College rears moral values and creates environment for moral teaching.

The institution has science laboratories, language club, computer club, debate club, cultural club, games and sports club related to academic curricula. It is committed to be flourished as a hub of education services.

Besides these, the concept of the house stimulates a healthy and competitive team spirit amongst the students. The houses named after the major rivers of Rajshahi Division. These are the Padma, the Tista, the Jamuna and the Dharla. Inter-House competitions, such as, debate, recitation, music, games and sports, wall-magazine, arts and crafts etc. is conducted regularly.

Our other facilities are canteen service, Pure Drinking Water Service, Library, Family Security Project, Science Laboratory, Computer Laboratory, Mobile Banking, Automation Management, SMS Service, Website etc.

Finally, it is a great privilege to lead this remarkable institution and I am optimistic that our joint effort can help us achieve a leading position in the field of education in the country.
